Being coming from a biochemistry and molecular biology backgrounds and after working with
biological database and data integration,  i have got really passionate about learning the
innards of computational biology. A big chunk of modern biology problems is hidden
underneath of high-throughput datasets that requires deeper understanding of computational 
principles to unravel. I haven't figured out a clear way to do that,  so will start of
with self-learning from web resources. Since its a vast learning area,  i have to narrow
it down to a list of primary topics and build a custom curriculum that are 
close to my interests. Then try to learn them gradually and see if there is useful online 
courses or local university offerings to help out.
